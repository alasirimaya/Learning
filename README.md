Learning Tracker App

Learning Tracker is a productivity app designed to help users build consistent study habits and achieve their learning goals. Users set their own learning objectives, choose the duration for their learning plan, and track their progress daily with a streak-based system. The app includes a "Freeze" feature that allows users to take breaks without losing their streak, encouraging balance and sustained commitment.

Features

Personalized Learning Goals: Users set what they want to learn and select the time frame (day, month, year).
Daily Streak Tracking: Track daily progress with a streak counter, which reflects ongoing commitment to learning.
Freeze Days: The app allows a limited number of "Freeze" days for flexibility, letting users take breaks without resetting their streak. However, if too many freezes are used, the streak will reset.
Usage

Set Learning Goals: Enter your specific learning objective and the target number of days, months, or years to reach this goal.
Track Daily Progress: Mark each day as complete to keep your streak alive.
Freeze Days: Use Freeze days wisely to prevent burnout. Exceeding the allowed freezes will reset your streak.
